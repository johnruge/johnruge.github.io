**Water On My Block** is a community-driven flood reporting platform built to empower South Side Chicago residents with the tools to document, visualize, and validate local flooding events. Designed with accessibility and real-world impact in mind, the platform features a 9-step progressive form that captures over 18 detailed metrics about each flooding incident, enabling real-time data collection and validation. Through interactive maps and rich data visualizations, residents can explore patterns in their community and contribute to a growing public record of environmental data.

The frontend is built with React.js, featuring a responsive, mobile-first design that ensures users can submit reports on the go. On the backend, the system leverages Node.js and Express.js to deliver a robust RESTful API, backed by MongoDB for flexible, schema-less data storage. Security is central to the platform, with JWT-based authentication, session management, and role-based route protection securing user access.

The application is deployed on AWS EC2, using NGINX as a reverse proxy for enhanced performance and reliability. SSL/TLS encryption ensures secure communication, and production-grade health checks and monitoring keep the platform resilient. Water On My Block combines modern web technologies with a mission-driven approach to support environmental justice and community empowerment through open, verifiable flood reporting.
