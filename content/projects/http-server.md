This HTTP/1.1 server is a high-performance implementation built entirely from scratch in Go, showcasing a strong command of networking protocols and concurrent programming. Fully compliant with HTTP/1.1 specifications, the server supports persistent connections through keep-alive, allowing for faster and more efficient communication. It includes optimized static file serving and a flexible routing system for dynamic content, making it suitable for a wide range of web applications. Designed for scalability, the server leverages goroutines and channels to handle over 100 concurrent connections seamlessly. With a focus on speed, it consistently delivers sub-50ms response times, making it both powerful and responsive for real-world use cases.
