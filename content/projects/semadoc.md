SemaDoc is an AI-powered documentation tool developed for the University of Chicago’s Computer Science Instructional Laboratory (CSIL), designed to automate and streamline documentation workflows. By harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs), SemaDoc generates high-quality documentation with minimal human input, significantly reducing the time and effort required. It integrates seamlessly with Trello through asynchronous APIs, enabling smooth project tracking and task management. Built for scalability, SemaDoc supports over 500 concurrent users while maintaining sub-100ms database response times, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience. Widely adopted across eight CSIL teams, the tool has transformed the way documentation is handled—cutting processes that once took hours down to mere minutes. SemaDoc is used for a range of documentation needs, including project status updates, API references, and technical specifications, making it an essential productivity tool across the organization.
