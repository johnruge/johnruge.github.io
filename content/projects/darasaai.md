DarasaAI is a full-featured Learning Management System (LMS) built with Spring Boot, designed to serve the academic needs of students and educators. The system delivers a comprehensive suite of educational tools, including assignments, notes, and timed tests, supported by a robust backend architecture. It features a well-structured API with 47 REST endpoints across 10 controllers, enabling seamless interaction with core LMS functionalities. Security is a central focus, with JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and BCrypt password hashing ensuring that user data remains protected. The platform supports complete user management, allowing differentiated access for teachers, students, and administrators. Built as a monolithic application, DarasaAI offers a stable and scalable foundation for educational environments. My goal is to deploy DarasaAI in educational institutions across Africa, helping them centralize course management, streamline student assessments, and efficiently distribute learning resources. I am currently working on integrating AI capabilities to enhance its functionality and impact even further.
