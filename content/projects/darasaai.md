# DarasaAI

DarasaAI is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) built with Spring Boot, designed to provide robust educational functionality for students.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive API**: 47 REST endpoints across 10 controllers
- **Core LMS Functionality**: Assignments, notes, and timed tests
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Password Security**: BCrypt password hashing for user data protection
- **User Management**: Complete user data and access control for teachers, students, and admins

## Technical Implementation

The application follows a monolithic architecture using Spring Boot, providing a solid foundation for educational technology needs. The system implements secure authentication patterns and comprehensive data management capabilities.

## Impact

I plan to use this system to enable educational institutions in Africa to manage their academic content efficiently, providing a centralized platform for course management, student assessment, and educational resource distribution. I am currently working on integrating AI to the application.
