# LZW File Compressor

A complete implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm in C, providing lossless data compression with robust error handling.

## Key Features

- **Lossless Compression**: Complete LZW algorithm implementation
- **File I/O**: Efficient file reading and writing operations
- **Edge Case Handling**: Robust handling of recursive decoding scenarios
- **Unknown Code Management**: Prefix-based table traversal for error recovery
