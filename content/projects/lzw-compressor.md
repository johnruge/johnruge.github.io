The LZW File Compressor is a full implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless compression algorithm, written in C to deliver efficient and reliable data compression. It supports robust file I/O operations, enabling smooth reading and writing of data during both compression and decompression. The implementation is designed to handle edge cases effectively, including complex recursive decoding scenarios, ensuring accurate restoration of original content. Additionally, it features intelligent error recovery through prefix-based table traversal, allowing it to gracefully manage unknown codes during decoding. This project demonstrates a solid grasp of compression theory, memory management, and fault-tolerant systems programming.
